/**
 * Community forest milestone celebrations (Issue #1646).
 *
 * The thresholds follow the configuration pattern already used for sponsor
 * badges (`lib/gamification/sponsor-badges.ts`): a module level list of
 * thresholds with a human readable title. Every community forest celebrates
 * the same ladder, and the celebration itself is persisted per project so a
 * milestone is only ever celebrated once.
 *
 * The metric is *trees planted* — trees that are actually in the ground
 * (`planted`, `verified` or `completed`). Monetary contributions are never
 * converted into planted trees, because the platform has no conversion rule
 * for that.
