/**
 * Community forest projects — pooled sponsorship with shared impact
 * (Issue #1646).
 *
 * A community forest is a *named* project that several sponsors contribute to
 * together. It always sits on top of an existing project from the platform
 * catalogue (the "base project"), so the platform keeps a single project
 * concept: the base project owns the type, location, description and
 * verification status, while the community forest adds the pooled
 * sponsorship layer (participants, collective impact, group leaderboard and
 * milestone celebrations) on top of it.
 *
 * Sponsors are Stellar wallets, exactly like everywhere else in the app
 * (`trees.sponsor_wallet`, `sponsor_team_members.wallet`, `sponsor_cohorts.wallet`).
